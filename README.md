# RoundCube SQL Multi-Contacts
Roundcube Plugin to create an Address Book from list of users in the SQL View.
Currently Natively Supporting:
+ iRedMail
+ [anything you create a MySQL View for]

By Default ALL Books are DISABLED.
You will have to enable them after you enable the plugin!

The Configuration File has been annotated and should prove easy to understand.
Feel free to contact me directly at postmaster@webdevguru.co.uk if you have any queries or requests!
